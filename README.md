# EventDateApp (working title)
iOS app similar to Tinder, to meet people in the same event where you currently are

# Description
Nowadays, apps like Tinder and Happn are immensely popular. However, the perfect place to meet people still isn't on your couch swiping people left and right, but on parties/festivals/other events! That is were this app comes in. When you are at an event, you log in with your Facebook account and you select the event you're at. Then you see all people that use the app and are on that event too. When you like someone who also likes you, you can chat and share your location to meet up IRL just moments after you got matched! 

# Features
* Log in using Facebook
* From your list of Facebook-events that you 'Attend', select the event you're at (when I have enough time, I want to automate this using your location and events)
* 'Wall' with all users that are at the same event as you
* You can "Like" users you'd like to meet, or "Not today" users that you don't
* When you Like someone who Liked you, you have a match and can chat with them and share location
* Settings: Select gender of users you want to see.

# Data sets/APIs
* Parse.com will be used for the server
* The Facebook iOS SDK will be used for the user's profile pictures and events

# Potential problems
I expect the most problems in implementing the server with the app (for example something like the chat, letting your profile show up on other user's wall, etc), as I've never done anything with that before. I'm also going to implement the app in Swift, with which I have no experience. So have a lot of learning to do in these two aspects!
