# PALA
iOS app similar to Tinder, to meet people in the same event where you currently are

# Description
Nowadays, apps like Tinder and Happn are immensely popular. However, the perfect place to meet people still isn't on your couch swiping people left and right, but on parties/festivals/other events! That is were Pala comes in. You log in with your Facebook account you select the event you want to meet new people at. Then you see all people that use the app and are attending that event too. When you "Like" someone who also "Likes" you, you can chat to meet up IRL just moments after you got matched!
